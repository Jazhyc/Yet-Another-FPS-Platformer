This game is a simple platformer with a dash of FPS elements that steals inspiration from games like Doom and Portal. The game consists of three levels with an increasing number of mechanics that utilize unity's various systems.

In the first level, the player has to navigate through a combination of static and moving platforms using the abilities described above. At the end of the stage, the player must perform some wall jumps to complete the level.

The FPS aspect becomes prevalent in the second level. The player can use a hitscan pistol on a series of targets to practice their aim. Once the targets take sufficient damage, they gain ragdoll physics. The dummies are then deleted and leave behind an explosion that makes extensive use of unity's particle system.

Finally, in the third level, enemies have simple AI. There are two kinds of enemies: Movers and Gunners. The movers exist primarily as moving targets for the player to destroy. However, the gunners are capable of sending projectiles that can damage the player. If the player's HP reaches 0, then the level is reset. To complete this level, the player must use both the platforming and FPS mechanics of the game.

This text file is an abstract summary of the game that describes it in general gaming terms. I have added comments to the script present in the game's source code that explains how various mechanics and objects are programmed. I referred to multiple online sources such as the unity forums, youtube, and the past lectures of the course to program the game. 

Video games have given me many memories and experiences. Likewise, I hope that this simple game can make someone's day just a bit better.
